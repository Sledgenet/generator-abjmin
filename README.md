## generator-abjmin
_Minimal Angular + Bootstrap + jQuery project generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)_

####Setup
You can perform a local installation by following the "**Running the generator**" instructions [on the Yeoman site](http://yeoman.io/authoring/). At the time of writing, you will need to pop a fully furnished "node_modules" folder in the project directory (or one of its root directories) after you link the generator. You can create this folder by doing a full installation of generator-webapp (see [Getting Started](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html)) and using it to generate a webapp project.

####Usage
cd into the project directory, which will ideally be sitting on a server.

    yo abjmin

Enter the project name, after which the project will be scaffolded for you (internet connection required).
